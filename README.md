Welcome to the first prototype release for PET ADOPTION APP! 

To use, run the back and frontends and open the frontend locally.



You can create a new user to view pets and apply to adopt, or you can login using the admin credentials to edit, create, and delete pets or applications.



email: admin@pets.com pass: password



Enjoy this functional but ugly release!
